### Implementations of NILM disaggegregators using Neural Networks
- Source : https://github.com/OdysseasKr/neural-disaggregator

* The project is used to compare the performance with our implementation

### Instructions
- Visit the above project site
- Download the following 6 source codes and copy them in the directory(/benchmark)
  * /DAE/daedisaggregator.py
  * /DAE/metrics.py
  * /GRU/grudisaggregator.py
  * /RNN/rnndisaggregator.py
  * /ShortSeq2Point/shortseq2pointdisaggregator.py
  * /WindowGRU/windowgrudisaggregator.py
  
- In case of ResNet, we modified the original source code for our purpose.
  Original source code is available at https://github.com/rgtzths/ICMLC_ICWAPR_code_base

  * ResNet.py
