Public datasets used for the project

* Enertalk
* UK-DALE

And, NILMTK that is used as the base framework requires hierarchical data format (HDF) with file extension of ".h5"

Therefore, in this directory, there must be two public dataset files named enertalk.h5 and ukdale.h5

### Enertalk
Enertalk dataset is provided the following site
- https://github.com/ch-shin/ENERTALK-dataset

The ENERTALK Dataset, 15 Hz Electricity Consumption Data from 22 Houses in South Korea.
The dataset is not provided as HDF format. Instead, the site provides the original csv files.

However, a separate nilmtk-converter that transfroms csv files into HDF format is avaiable on the above site.

Please, refer to the following actions for converting original dataset into HDF format (.h5)
- pip install tqdm
- run the following actions in order
  ** run metadata_generator.py (also can be run in jupyter notebook after changing into ipynb file)
  **	run convert_enertalk.py (also can be run in jupyter notebook after changing into ipynb file)

#### Trouble shooting
- max_sample_period is missing in entertalk dataset metadata
  * max_sample_period has to be inserted manually on the metadata generated by executing metadata_generator.py and then convert_enertalk.py has to be run
- NILMTK-related code modification is required
  train_elec = dataset.buildings[1].elec
  #train_mains = train_elec.mains().all_meters()[0] # Not working for enertalk dataset
  train_mains = train_elec.all_meters()[0]          # Proper use
 

### UK-DALE

ukdale.h5 file which is included in ukdale.h5.tgz can be directed acquired from the following site
- https://data.ukedc.rl.ac.uk/browse/edc/efficiency/residential/EnergyConsumption/Domestic/UK-DALE-2015/UK-DALE-disaggregated

* Due to license issue, those public datasets are not provided here!
