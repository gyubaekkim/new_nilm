Public datasets used for the project

* Enertalk
* UK-DALE

And, NILMTK that is used as the base framework requires hierarchical data format (HDF) with file extension of ".h5"

Therefore, in this directory, there must be two public dataset files named enertalk.h5 and ukdale.h5

### Enertalk


### UK-DALE

ukdale.h5 file can be directed downloaded from the following site
- https://data.ukedc.rl.ac.uk/browse/edc/efficiency/residential/EnergyConsumption/Domestic/UK-DALE-2015/UK-DALE-disaggregated

* Due to license issue, those public datasets are not provided here!
