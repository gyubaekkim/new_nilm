    "- Description\n",
    "  * Various algorithms have been utilized by disaggregation systems. The existing methods adopted neural network-based algorithms. The neural \n",
    "  network-based algorithms performed better than combinational optimization and hidden Markov models. Thus, we compared the \n",
    "  performance of the neural network-based algorithms and decision tree-based ensemble algorithms, such as random forest and gradient \n",
    "  boosting machine (GBM).\n",
