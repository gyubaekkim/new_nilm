Public datasets used for the project

* Enertalk

And, NILMTK that is used as the base framework requires hierarchical data format (HDF) with file extension of ".h5"

Therefore, in this directory, there must be public dataset file named enertalk.h5

### Enertalk
Enertalk dataset is provided at the following site
- https://github.com/ch-shin/ENERTALK-dataset

The ENERTALK Dataset, 15 Hz Electricity Consumption Data from 22 Houses in South Korea.
The dataset is not provided as HDF format. Instead, the site provides the original csv files.

However, a separate nilmtk-converter that transfroms csv files into HDF format is avaiable on the above site.

Please, refer to the following actions for converting original dataset into HDF format (.h5)
- pip install tqdm
- run the following actions in order
  * run metadata_generator.py (also can be run in jupyter notebook after changing into ipynb file)
  *	run convert_enertalk.py (also can be run in jupyter notebook after changing into ipynb file)

#### Trouble shooting
- max_sample_period is missing in entertalk dataset metadata
  * max_sample_period has to be inserted manually on the metadata generated by executing metadata_generator.py and then convert_enertalk.py has to be run
- NILMTK-related code modification is required
  * train_elec = dataset.buildings[1].elec
  * #train_mains = train_elec.mains().all_meters()[0] # Not working for enertalk dataset
  * train_mains = train_elec.all_meters()[0]          # Proper use
 

* Due to license issue, the public dataset is not provided here!
